                <ol start="2">
                <li><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><u>Information Collected or Received from You</u></p>
                <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Honeyfi Account), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
                <p><u>Honeyfi Account Information</u></p>
                <p>If you create a Honeyfi Account, we&rsquo;ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, and phone number, which is personally identifiable information or &ldquo;PII.&rdquo; PII does not include information that is anonymous, aggregated, or is no longer identifiable to a specific person. &nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Bank Account Information</u></p>
                <p>If you want to link a bank account that you hold with a U.S. financial institution (&ldquo;Bank Account&rdquo;) to your Honeyfi Account, we will collect certain information from you about your Bank Account, such as your online login credentials, for the purpose of providing the Services to you. If you give us access to your Bank Account, you acknowledge and agree that Honeyfi and our third-party service providers will have access to your transaction information, amount of funds, and other information about you and your Bank Account that may be available through the online settings for your Bank Account or otherwise through the relevant financial institution (&ldquo;Financial Information&rdquo;) that we require in order to provide the Services to you.</p>
                <p><u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</u></p>
                <p>Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;&nbsp;are small text files that are placed on your device by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you&rsquo;ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don&rsquo;t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Web Beacons&rdquo;&nbsp;(also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user&rsquo;s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an email).</p>
                <p><u>Information Related to Use of the Services</u></p>
                <p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how our users (each, a &ldquo;User&rdquo;) use our Services (we refer to this information as &ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;). Log Data may include information such as a User&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize, and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users&rsquo; needs and preferences. We may use a person&rsquo;s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. We may use third party data collection tools such as Google Analytics to provide us with analytics data regarding Users&rsquo; interactions with our Services. You may visit the&nbsp;Google Analytics opt-out page&nbsp;for instructions on how to opt out Google Analytic&rsquo;s automatic retention of data collected while using the Services.</p>
                <p><u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</u></p>
                <p>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
                <p><u>Location Information</u></p>
                <p>When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device&rsquo;s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>
                <ol start="3">
                <li><strong>Information that We Share with Third Parties</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We will never sell your PII to any third parties. We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>
                <p><u>Information You Share with Others</u></p>
                <p>You may use our Services to connect and share information with others, including your partner and financial advisor(s). When you share and communicate with others using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you add new bank accounts or credit cards to your Honeyfi account, you decide whether your partner can see your Account Information, including account balances and transaction history. You are solely responsible for deciding with whom to share and communicate using our Services. You can change your account sharing preferences in your Settings in your account. If you have questions or concerns about sharing information with our Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@honeyfi.com">support@honeyfi.com</a>.</p>
                <p><u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers</u></p>
                <p>We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</p>
                <p>We use Plaid Technologies, Inc. (“Plaid”) to gather user data from financial institutions. By using our service, you grant Honeyfi and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the <a href="https://plaid.com/legal/">Plaid Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                <p><u>Information Shared with our Marketing Partners</u></p>
                <p>We will never share your Financial Information with our marketing partners without your express consent, but we may use your Financial Information to generate offers for financial products and services from our marketing partners that may be of interest to you. It is always your choice whether or not to apply for an offered product or service and we will never submit an application for a financial product or service on your behalf without your express consent. If you choose to pursue any of the offers that the Services present to you, you may be asked if you would like the Services to pass on your PII and relevant Financial Information to the third-party marketing partner as a convenience. For example, if the Services generate an offer from a third-party loan provider for you, the Services may give you the option of moving forward with that offer within the App, and if you agree to do so, the Services will pass your PII and relevant Financial Information to that third-party loan provider to speed up the process of your application.</p>
                <p><u>Information Shared with Other Third Parties</u></p>
                <p>We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. For example, we may use aggregated and non-identifying information to derive statistics about the spending habits of our users, and publish blog posts or articles on our Site about things such as popular restaurants or bars in certain areas.</p>
                <p><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</u></p>
                <p>Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
                <p><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</u></p>
                <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

                <li><strong><u>Your Choices</u></strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we&rsquo;ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</p>
                <p><u>Opt-Out</u></p>
                <p>We may periodically send you free newsletters and emails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; (either through your Honeyfi Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications &ndash; e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.</p>
