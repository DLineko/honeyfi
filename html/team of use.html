                </ol>
                <p>The Honeyfi Service is a personal finance information management service that allows you to consolidate and track your financial information. The Service also lets you collaborate with others, including your partner, by sharing access to your financial information and communicating about your personal finances.</p>
                <p>The Services may also present you with information relating to third-party products or services that you may be interested in. The Services may also provide you general tips, recommendations, and educational material.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li><strong> Account Information from Third-Party Sites</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Users may direct Honeyfi to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts, or engage in financial transactions (&ldquo;Account Information&rdquo;). Honeyfi works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Honeyfi does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement. Honeyfi is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</p>
                <p>Honeyfi cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in the failure to obtain data, the loss of data or personalization settings, and other service interruptions. Honeyfi cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery, or failure to store any user data, communications, or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</p>

                <p>You may use our Services to connect and share information with others, including your partner and financial advisor(s). When you share and communicate with others using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you add new bank accounts or credit cards to your Honeyfi account, you decide whether your partner can see your Account Information, including account balances and transaction history. You are solely responsible for deciding with whom to share and communicate using our Services.</p>
                <p>Other people may also use our Services to share and communicate with you. For example, your partner may add a new bank account and decide to share access to his or her account balances and transaction history. You are solely responsible for deciding whether to allow others to share and communicate with you using our Services.</p>
                <p>You can change your account sharing preferences in your Settings in your account. If you have questions or concerns about sharing information with our Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@honeyfi.com">support@honeyfi.com</a>.</p>

Depending upon which alerts you select, information such as an account balance or the due date for your credit card payment may be included.

                <p>Delaware state law governs this Agreement without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.</p>
                <p>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply Delaware law to all other matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND HONEYFI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</p>
                <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Honeyfi, Inc., in care of our registered agent Harvard Business Services, Inc., 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA&rsquo;s rules, which are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, we will pay them for you. We will not seek attorney&rsquo;s fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of this Agreement.</p>
